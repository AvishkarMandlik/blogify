## üîê Authentication & OTP Workflow

* **JWT-based login/signup** storing the token in `localStorage`
* On login, **user profile** is fetched and stored in `sessionStorage`
* **Passwords** are securely hashed using **bcryptjs**
* All protected routes verify JWT token with **middleware**
* On signup and login reset, OTP is sent via **SMTP (NodeMailer)** to user email for verification
* OTP is time-bound and verified before completing the action (Signup, Login, Reset Password)
